Hello! I want to share with you my ambitious career transformation and personal development strategy for 2025. This is a story about how I plan to transition from a traditional developer job to the life of a successful solopreneur.

## Why did I choose this path?

The motivation is simple but powerful - I strive to create a stable income from my own products. My goal for this year is to achieve a monthly income of $5000+ from my own projects. It's not just about money - it's about freedom of choice, the ability to work on what truly inspires, and create products that bring real value to people.

## Multi-product approach strategy

Instead of betting everything on one project, I chose a diversification strategy. Several products are planned for this year:

- AI Social Media Post Writer - my first pilot project, scheduled to launch at the beginning of the year
- AI Cooking App - a culinary assistant, development of which will begin in the second quarter
- Several micro-SaaS projects that will be developed throughout the year

## Why AI?

I chose to focus on AI-powered products for three key reasons. First, AI technology's rapid evolution creates new opportunities for innovation. Second, my experience as a developer lets me combine technical skills with solving real user problems. Third, the AI market's strong growth potential makes it ideal for launching new products.

## Balance and realism

An important aspect of my strategy is a balanced approach to time. I allocate 10-15 hours per week for working on my own projects, distributing them between development, marketing, and learning. This allows me to keep my main job while my own projects start generating stable income.

## Clear action plan

My strategy is broken down into clear quarterly goals, focusing on the sequential launch and development of each product. I pay special attention to rapid MVP development and idea validation before a full launch.

## What's next?

I understand that the path won't be easy, but I have a clear plan and motivation. I will share my progress and lessons learned. If you also dream about your own projects - let's move towards this goal together!

P.S. Stay tuned for updates - the first project will see the light in January 2025!

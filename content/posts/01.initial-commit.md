Every significant project begins with that first commit – the initial push that sets everything in motion. Today, I'm making the most important commit of my career: the decision to transform my path from a 9-to-5 software engineer to an independent solopreneur. Like any good developer, I'm choosing to build this journey in public, documenting every step, success, and setback along the way.

## Why Build in Public?

The software development world has always championed open source – we share code, contribute to repositories, and learn from each other's implementations. Building in public follows the same principle, but extends beyond just code. By sharing my journey transparently, I'm creating my own live documentation that others can learn from, fork, and improve upon.

## The Transition Blueprint

My strategy isn't to abruptly terminate my stable engineering position. Instead, I'm approaching this like a well-planned system migration. The first year will serve as my transition period, where I'll gradually shift from being purely a software engineer to establishing my independent ventures.

Think of it as running two parallel processes: maintaining the stability of my current role while bootstrapping my entrepreneurial endeavors. This approach provides both financial security and the space to experiment with different business models.

## Committing to Transparency

Just as we track changes in version control, I'll be documenting my progress, setbacks, and learnings. This includes:

- Monthly revenue reports and key metrics
- Technical decisions and their outcomes
- Time management strategies for balancing employment and entrepreneurship
- Failed attempts and lessons learned

## The Path Forward

Financial independence isn't just about replacing a salary – it's about building systems that generate value sustainably. As an engineer, I'm uniquely positioned to create technical solutions that scale. By leveraging my software development background, I can build tools and services that solve real problems while creating passive income streams.

Join me on this journey as I transform from writing code for others to architecting my own future. Follow along to see real numbers, honest reflections, and the unfiltered reality of a software engineer's path to solopreneurship.
